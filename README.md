## CPPFinanceML

CPPFINanceML is a personal project that implements fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch in C++ for financial prediction. The project includes implementations of Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these algorithms by building them from the ground up, without relying on external libraries.

### Features
- **Linear Regression:** Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression models.
- **Support Vector Machines:** Custom SVM implementation for classification and regression tasks.
- **Neural Networks:** Basic neural network architecture with forward and backward propagation for training.

### Usage
This project is ideal for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of machine learning algorithms and their applications in financial data analysis.
